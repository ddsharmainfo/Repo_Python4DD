## Thread Pool

In Python, a thread pool is a mechanism that manages a collection of threads, allowing you to efficiently execute tasks in parallel without the overhead of creating and destroying threads for each task. Thread pools are useful when you have a large number of tasks that can be executed concurrently, and you want to manage the threading overhead and resource usage.

There are two ways to  manage and execute tasks concurrently using a pool of threads.
1) ThreadPool
2) ThreadPoolExecutor

They are part of different modules and offer slightly different features.

**ThreadPool**:
* ThreadPool is part of the `multiprocessing.pool` module.
* It provides a simple way to create a pool of worker threads for parallel execution of tasks.
* It is commonly used with the `map` function to distribute tasks among the available threads.
* It's relatively basic compared to `ThreadPoolExecutor` and doesn't offer as much control over task management and error handling.

**ThreadPoolExecutor**:
* `ThreadPoolExecutor` is part of the `concurrent.futures` module.
* It provides a higher-level interface for managing a thread pool.
* It offers more advanced features, such as the ability to submit tasks individually, handle exceptions, and control task dependencies.
* It provides the `submit` method to asynchronously schedule tasks and obtain `Future` objects representing their results.
* It allows using the `as_completed` and `wait` functions for managing and waiting for task completion.

In summary, `ThreadPool` is a simpler option for basic parallel execution using a thread pool, whereas `ThreadPoolExecutor` provides more advanced control and features for managing parallel tasks in a thread pool. If you need more control, error handling, and flexibility, `ThreadPoolExecutor` is generally the better choice.
